# neural-networks-from-scratch-net

While trying to learn about neural networks I found this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3

While they use Python in the tutorial, they explain every concept in a way that a programmer without too much math knowledge can follow along, and even implement the code in another languge.

The book at https://nnfs.io/ is a great compliment.

## This repo

This repo is just my C# (.NET 6.0 RC1) implementations of each of the parts of the tutorial as I go along. My goal is to not use any third party libraries and implement everything in C# from scratch.
